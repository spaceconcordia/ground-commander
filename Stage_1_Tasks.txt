Radio hardware programming
Skills required: C/C++, some RF
- program the TNC to be compatible with the Netman, or find compatible package

Antenna Control
- control the motors to point the antenna based on values provided by STK

Log Management and Interpretation:
- take our split archives on the fly and reassemble them in an organized fashion into a file system (determine a good file structure)
- interpret error codes present in log entries and beautify/humanify them
-

Error Interpretation and Translation - Error Class
Skills Required: C++ knowledge

- write an error class 
    Error IDs are managed in SpaceDecl.h and in the respective system. 
    No collisions should occur with the SpaceDecl.h codes. 
    Otherwise, when we are entering the log file for a certain subsystems, 
        the ground station software should enter a mode to interpret that systems error codes. 
    e.g. Helium error log is opened, open an instance of the error class for helium, or relate the helium ID and status code. 
    TODO expand and clarify

Ground Commander
Skills required: C++ knowledge, Linux
Level: Advanced

- write a command-line interface/API to control and display execution of ground-commander, ground netman, transceiver status, etc
- Write the new main function from the ground to be compatible with space-commander, and ground netman
-

Ground Station IT support
Skills required: Linux

- encrypt, secure, and backup our systems (e.g. entire backup computer in case primary one goes down)
- create webserver to display the satellite status publicly
- enable secure remote access as admissible
- create email alerts to admins if something on ground station goes wrong
- enable camera feed of the antenna
-
